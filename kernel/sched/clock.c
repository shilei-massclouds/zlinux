 *
 * What this file implements:
 *
 * cpu_clock(i) provides a fast (execution time) high resolution
 * clock with bounded drift between CPUs. The value of cpu_clock(i)
 * is monotonic for constant i. The timestamp returned is in nanoseconds.
 *
 * ######################### BIG FAT WARNING ##########################
 * # when comparing cpu_clock(i) to cpu_clock(j) for i != j, time can #
 * # go backwards !!                                                  #
 * ####################################################################
 *
 * There is no strict promise about the base, although it tends to start
 * at 0 on boot (but people really shouldn't rely on that).
 *
 * cpu_clock(i)       -- can be used from any context, including NMI.
 * local_clock()      -- is cpu_clock() on the current CPU.
 *
 * sched_clock_cpu(i)
 *
 * How it is implemented:
 *
 * The implementation either uses sched_clock() when
 * !CONFIG_HAVE_UNSTABLE_SCHED_CLOCK, which means in that case the
 * sched_clock() is assumed to provide these properties (mostly it means
 * the architecture provides a globally synchronized highres time source).
 *
 * Otherwise it tries to create a semi stable clock from a mixture of other
 * clocks, including:
 *
 *  - GTOD (clock monotonic)
 *  - sched_clock()
 *  - explicit idle events
 *
 * We use GTOD as base and use sched_clock() deltas to improve resolution. The
 * deltas are filtered to provide monotonicity and keeping it within an
 * expected window.
 *
 * Furthermore, explicit sleep and wakeup hooks allow us to account for time
 * that is otherwise invisible (TSC gets stopped).
