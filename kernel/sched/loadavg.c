/*
 * Global load-average calculations
 *
 * We take a distributed and async approach to calculating the global load-avg
 * in order to minimize overhead.
 *
 * The global load average is an exponentially decaying average of nr_running +
 * nr_uninterruptible.
 *
 * Once every LOAD_FREQ:
 *
 *   nr_active = 0;
 *   for_each_possible_cpu(cpu)
 *  nr_active += cpu_of(cpu)->nr_running + cpu_of(cpu)->nr_uninterruptible;
 *
 *   avenrun[n] = avenrun[0] * exp_n + nr_active * (1 - exp_n)
 *
 * Due to a number of reasons the above turns in the mess below:
 *
 *  - for_each_possible_cpu() is prohibitively expensive on machines with
 *    serious number of CPUs, therefore we need to take a distributed approach
 *    to calculating nr_active.
 *
 *        \Sum_i x_i(t) = \Sum_i x_i(t) - x_i(t_0) | x_i(t_0) := 0
 *                      = \Sum_i { \Sum_j=1 x_i(t_j) - x_i(t_j-1) }
 *
 *    So assuming nr_active := 0 when we start out -- true per definition, we
 *    can simply take per-CPU deltas and fold those into a global accumulate
 *    to obtain the same result. See calc_load_fold_active().
 *
 *    Furthermore, in order to avoid synchronizing all per-CPU delta folding
 *    across the machine, we assume 10 ticks is sufficient time for every
 *    CPU to have completed this task.
 *
 *    This places an upper-bound on the IRQ-off latency of the machine. Then
 *    again, being late doesn't loose the delta, just wrecks the sample.
 *
 *  - cpu_rq()->nr_uninterruptible isn't accurately tracked per-CPU because
 *    this would add another cross-CPU cacheline miss and atomic operation
 *    to the wakeup path. Instead we increment on whatever CPU the task ran
 *    when it went into uninterruptible state and decrement on whatever CPU
 *    did the wakeup. This means that only the sum of nr_uninterruptible over
 *    all CPUs yields the correct result.
 *
 *  This covers the NO_HZ=n code, for extra head-aches, see the comment below.
