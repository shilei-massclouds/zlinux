 * stop_cpu[s]() is simplistic per-cpu maximum priority cpu

 * function to be executed on a single or multiple cpus preempting all

 * Resources for this mechanism are preallocated when a cpu is brought
 * up and requests are guaranteed to be served as long as the target
 * cpus are online.

 * holding a spinlock or inside any other preempt-disabled region when
 * @fn() runs.
 *
 * This can be thought of as a very heavy write lock, equivalent to
