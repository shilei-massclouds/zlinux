 * rcu_dereference_check() - rcu_dereference with debug checking

 * @c: The conditions under which the dereference will take place
 *
 * Do an rcu_dereference(), but check that the conditions under which the
 * dereference will take place are correct.  Typically the conditions
 * indicate the various locking conditions that should be held at that
 * point.  The check should return true if the conditions are satisfied.
 * An implicit check for being in an RCU read-side critical section
 * (rcu_read_lock()) is included.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 *  bar = rcu_dereference_check(foo->bar, lockdep_is_held(&foo->lock));
 *
 * could be used to indicate to lockdep that foo->bar may only be dereferenced
 * if either rcu_read_lock() is held, or that the lock required to replace
 * the bar struct at foo->bar is held.
 *
 * Note that the list of conditions may also include indications of when a lock
 * need not be held, for example during initialisation or destruction of the
 * target struct:
 *
 *  bar = rcu_dereference_check(foo->bar, lockdep_is_held(&foo->lock) ||
 *                        atomic_read(&foo->usage) == 0);
 *
 * Inserts memory barriers on architectures that require them
 * (currently only the Alpha), prevents the compiler from refetching
 * (and from merging fetches), and, more importantly, documents exactly
 * which pointers are protected by RCU and checks that the pointer is
 * annotated as __rcu.

/**
 * rcu_read_lock() - mark the beginning of an RCU read-side critical section
 *
 * When synchronize_rcu() is invoked on one CPU while other CPUs
 * are within RCU read-side critical sections, then the
 * synchronize_rcu() is guaranteed to block until after all the other
 * CPUs exit their critical sections.  Similarly, if call_rcu() is invoked
 * on one CPU while other CPUs are within RCU read-side critical
 * sections, invocation of the corresponding RCU callback is deferred
 * until after the all the other CPUs exit their critical sections.
 *
 * In v5.0 and later kernels, synchronize_rcu() and call_rcu() also
 * wait for regions of code with preemption disabled, including regions of
 * code with interrupts or softirqs disabled.  In pre-v5.0 kernels, which
 * define synchronize_sched(), only code enclosed within rcu_read_lock()
 * and rcu_read_unlock() are guaranteed to be waited for.
 *
 * Note, however, that RCU callbacks are permitted to run concurrently
 * with new RCU read-side critical sections.  One way that this can happen
 * is via the following sequence of events: (1) CPU 0 enters an RCU
 * read-side critical section, (2) CPU 1 invokes call_rcu() to register
 * an RCU callback, (3) CPU 0 exits the RCU read-side critical section,
 * (4) CPU 2 enters a RCU read-side critical section, (5) the RCU
 * callback is invoked.  This is legal, because the RCU read-side critical
 * section that was running concurrently with the call_rcu() (and which
 * therefore might be referencing something that the corresponding RCU
 * callback would free up) has completed before the corresponding
 * RCU callback is invoked.
 *
 * RCU read-side critical sections may be nested.  Any deferred actions
 * will be deferred until the outermost RCU read-side critical section
 * completes.
 *
 * You can avoid reading and understanding the next paragraph by
 * following this rule: don't put anything in an rcu_read_lock() RCU
 * read-side critical section that would block in a !PREEMPTION kernel.
 * But if you want the full story, read on!
 *
 * In non-preemptible RCU implementations (pure TREE_RCU and TINY_RCU),
 * it is illegal to block while in an RCU read-side critical section.
 * In preemptible RCU implementations (PREEMPT_RCU) in CONFIG_PREEMPTION
 * kernel builds, RCU read-side critical sections may be preempted,
 * but explicit blocking is illegal.  Finally, in preemptible RCU
 * implementations in real-time (with -rt patchset) kernel builds, RCU
 * read-side critical sections may be preempted and they may also block, but
 * only when acquiring spinlocks that are subject to priority inheritance.
