/*
 * Simple waitqueues are semantically very different to regular wait queues
 * (wait.h). The most important difference is that the simple waitqueue allows
 * for deterministic behaviour -- IOW it has strictly bounded IRQ and lock hold
 * times.
 *
 * Mainly, this is accomplished by two things. Firstly not allowing swake_up_all
 * from IRQ disabled, and dropping the lock upon every wakeup, giving a higher
 * priority task a chance to run.
 *
 * Secondly, we had to drop a fair number of features of the other waitqueue
 * code; notably:
 *
 *  - mixing INTERRUPTIBLE and UNINTERRUPTIBLE sleeps on the same waitqueue;
 *    all wakeups are TASK_NORMAL in order to avoid O(n) lookups for the right
 *    sleeper state.
 *
 *  - the !exclusive mode; because that leads to O(n) wakeups, everything is
 *    exclusive. As such swake_up_one will only ever awake _one_ waiter.
 *
 *  - custom wake callback functions; because you cannot give any guarantees
 *    about random code. This also allows swait to be used in RT, such that
 *    raw spinlock can be used for the swait queue head.
 *
 * As a side effect of these; the data structures are slimmer albeit more ad-hoc.
 * For all the above, note that simple wait queues should _only_ be used under
 * very specific realtime constraints -- it is best to stick with the regular
 * wait queues in most cases.
